# Ming

## Who?

[Ming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_(clam)), the clam, lived as long as 507 years.

## What for?

Recently I read [an article](https://github.com/zijie0/HumanSystemOptimization) about how to live more healthy and longer, and this site would be used to record everyday-time for bedding, eating, and sporting.
